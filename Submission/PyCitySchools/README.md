Homework for Module 4 - Pandas

In this assignment, we were given raw data for schools_complete and students_complete as Resource files.

With Jupiter Notebook, I've created a python script, PyCitySchools, that merged the data sets and ran metrics for the given data. With the metrics, I was able to compile tables useful for reviewing each school's performance, showcasing total numbers and percentages of passing scores for the students attending those schools. 

I've also included a written analysis of the dataset providing several conclusions we can draw from the tables and a possible area for further analysis.
